# Google-Browse

This is a very simple text browser which aids in searching and navigating on Google.com. Shows results as a simple list, any of which may be opened in a full
browser.

Not really intended for real use, since it is only really a toy.

WARNING: The high traffic from this tool will quickly get Google locking you out thinking that you are an evil scraper!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'google-browse'

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install google-browse

## Usage

    The gem provides a single command which starts the text search browser:

    $ google-browse

    $ google-browse "spooner github"
